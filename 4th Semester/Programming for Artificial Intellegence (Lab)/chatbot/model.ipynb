         "https://spacenews.com/electron-launches-first-nasa-prefire-earth-science-cubesat/",
         "LOS ANGELES — Rocket Lab launched the first of two NASA Earth science cubesats on an Electron rocket May 25, exactly seven years after the company’s first launch. The Electron lifted off from Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 3:41 a.m. Eastern after a brief hold because of ground winds. It placed into a 525-kilometer sun-synchronous orbit a 6U cubesat that is part of a NASA mission called Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment or PREFIRE. NASA announced it made contract with the PREFIRE cubesat five hours after liftoff, starting an in-orbit checkout of the satellite. It will be joined by a second, identical cubesat launched on another Electron. Both NASA and Rocket Lab said that launch will take place in the “coming days” but did not provide a specific date. NASA previously said it planned to launch the two cubesats no more than three weeks apart. The two PREFIRE cubesats, operating in different sun-synchronous orbital planes,  each carry a thermal infrared spectrometer . The spacecraft will measure the infrared emissions at the poles, filling in gaps in data about those regions that can be used to improve climate models. “This will improve prediction of sea ice loss, ice sheet melt and sea level rise, creating a better understanding of how our planet’s system will change in the coming years,” Karen St. Germain, NASA Earth science division director, said in a statement, “crucial information to farmers tracking changes in weather and water, fishing fleets working in changing seas and coastal communities building resilience.” NASA emphasized its use of commercial technologies in both the launch of the satellites as well as their use of cubesat technologies. NASA selected PREFIRE in 2018 at part of its Earth Venture line of instruments and missions with a cost cap of nearly $33 million. “The PREFIRE cubesats may be small, but they’re going to close a big gap in our knowledge about Earth’s energy budget,” said Laurie Leshin, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the center managing the mission, in the NASA statement. The launch was the sixth this year for Electron and the 48 th  overall for the small launch vehicle. It took place  seven years after the first Electron launch , which failed to reach orbit because of a problem with ground equipment that triggered the rocket’s flight termination system. “Missions like PREFIRE demonstrate the unique benefit of Electron: dedicated launch for small satellites to precise orbits on precise schedules,” Peter Beck, chief executive of Rocket Lab, said in a statement. Rocket Lab had been forecasting as many as 22 Electron launches this year, including two of a suborbital version called HASTE. In a May 6 earnings call, though,  the company said the company will likely fall short of 22 launches  because of what Beck called “a game of manifest whac-a-mole” as customers delay delivery of spacecraft. “It’s just super hard to predict as the customers move around,” he said when asked how many Electron launches the company now expected to carry out in 2024. “But I think it’s fair to say that, at this point, we’ll struggle to achieve 22, but we have line of sight for probably a couple of less than that.”",

         "https://spacenews.com/space-development-agency-to-procure-dedicated-ground-systems-for-missile-defense-experiments/",
         "WASHINGTON —  T he Space Development Agency (SDA)  announced plans  to procure two separate ground systems in support of its experimental missile defense satellites. These systems will be crucial for demonstrating advanced space-based sensors designed to track and destroy hypersonic missile threats. The first program, dubbed Advanced Fire Control Ground Infrastructure (AFCGI), will establish a cloud-based ground system at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. This system will serve as the nerve center to run missile tracking experiments, the first of which is the Foo Fighter constellation — short for Fire-control On Orbit Support to the Warfighter.  Millennium Space Systems r ecently secured a contract  to build eight satellites and provide initial ground support by 2027. “AFCGI represents a critical step towards demonstrating advanced fire control capabilities,” SDA Director Derek Tournear told reporters May 24. The agency is seeking a “common, enduring ground infrastructure” for fire control prototype programs. The Foo Fighter satellites will be used as a testbed for advanced sensor technology capable of detecting and tracking hypersonic missiles. The data collected by these satellites will support the development of a much larger constellation of tracking satellites in low Earth orbit that will be part of the Defense Department’s  Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture . SDA, an agency under the U.S. Space Force, plans to spend about $4 billion a year developing the PWSA.  Missile defense is an extraordinarily complex challenge, requiring seamless data flow between satellites, ground systems, and interceptor missiles to guide them to destroy threats in-flight. Tournear explained that SDA initially planned to acquire a single, generic ground system for all satellite demonstrations. However, the technical complexity of fire-control technology necessitated a different approach.  In addition to AFCGI to command the satellites themselves, SDA will also award a separate Advanced Fire Control Mission Integration (AFCMI) contract for processing and integrating the fire-control tracking data. The AFCMI system will take data from the Foo Fighters and future experiments, analyze it, and standardize the formatting so it can be utilized by the broader missile defense network. A solicitation for the AFCMI system will be issued this summer. A contract award is expected in early 2025, Tournear said. The decision to split the original ground system procurement stemmed from industry feedback, Tournear said. He explained that ground mission integration and data mission integration require distinct skill sets, and the two-pronged approach allows SDA to leverage the expertise best suited for each function.",

         "Bringing generative artificial intelligence to space",
         "https://spacenews.com/bringing-generative-artificial-intelligence-to-space/",
         "TAMPA, Fla. — Amazon Web Services is busy positioning its cloud infrastructure business to capitalize on the promise of generative artificial intelligence for transforming space and other industries. More than 60% of the company’s space and aerospace customers are already using some form of AI in their businesses, according to AWS director of aerospace and satellite Clint Crosier, up from single digits around three years ago. Crosier predicts similar growth over the next few years in space for generative AI, which  uses deep-learning models to answer questions or create content  based on patterns detected in massive datasets, marking a major step up from traditional machine-learning algorithms. Mathematical advances, an explosion in the amount of available data and cheaper and more efficient chips for processing it are a “perfect storm” for the rise of generative AI, he told  SpaceNews  in an interview, helping drive greater adoption of cloud-based applications. “In the last year, AWS has fundamentally reorganized itself internally so that we could put the right teams [and] organizational structure in place … so that we can really double down on generative AI,” he said. He said AWS has created a “generative AI for space” cell of a handful of people to engage with cloud customers to help develop next-generation capabilities. These efforts include a generative AI laboratory for customers to experiment with new ways of using these emerging capabilities.  Crosier sees three main areas for using generative AI in space: geospatial analytics, spacecraft design and constellation management. Earth observation satellite operators such as BlackSky and Capella Space already use these tools to help manage search queries and gain more insights into their geospatial data. It’s early days in the manufacturing sector, but Crosier said engineers are experimenting with how a generative AI model fed with design parameters could produce new concepts by drawing from potentially overlooked data, such as from the automotive industry. “Whether you’re designing a satellite, rocket or spacecraft, you’re letting the generative AI go out and do that exploratory work around the globe with decades of data,” he said, “and then it will come back and bring you novel design concepts that nobody has envisioned before for your team to use as a baseline to start refining.” He said generative AI also has the potential to help operators manage increasingly crowded orbits by helping to simulate testing scenarios. “If I have a constellation of 600 satellites, I want to model how that constellation will behave under various design parameters,” he said.  “Well, I can get a model of two concepts, which leaves me woefully inadequate — but it costs time and money to model them, or I can model an infinite number. Gen AI will tell me what are the top 25 cases I should model for my modeling simulation capability that will give me the best design optimization, and so we’re seeing it used that way.” AWS efforts to accelerate the adoption of these emerging computing capabilities also include scholarships and a commitment announced in November to provide free AI training for two million people worldwide before the end of 2025.",

         "https://spacenews.com/spacex-sets-early-june-launch-of-next-starship-test-flight/",
         "LOS ANGELES — SpaceX has set a June 5 launch date for its next Starship integrated test flight, with a focus on demonstrating the ability to bring both stages of the vehicle back intact. SpaceX announced May 24 it planned a launch of Starship on its fourth integrated flight test, also known as IFT-4, as soon as June 5 pending receipt of an updated Federal Aviation Administration license. That launch, like the previous three, will be from the company’s Starbase site in South Texas. Having demonstrated that the Starship upper stage, launched by its Super Heavy booster, can reach space, the company now wants to show it can bring both the booster and the ship back intact. “The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,” the company  stated . “The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.” Unlike  the third test flight in March , SpaceX doesn’t plan any in-flight tests of Starship, such as opening the vehicle’s payload bay door or transferring propellant. The vehicle will fly a similar trajectory with a splashdown of the ship in the Indian Ocean. “This flight path does not require a deorbit burn for reentry, maximizing public safety while still providing the opportunity to meet our primary objective of a controlled Starship reentry,” the company stated. SpaceX has made several upgrades to Starship hardware and software from the March flight, incorporating lessons learned from that mission. One change the company called out was that it will jettison the special interstage section between the booster and ship, designed to enable “hot-staging” where the ship ignites its engines while still attached to the booster. Disposing of that interstage after Super Heavy’s post-separation boostback burn, SpaceX stated, will “reduce booster mass for the final phase of flight.” The company also released May 24  details about the issues it encountered on the third Starship flight . While Starship reached space, the vehicle was lost during reentry. The Super Heavy booster separately broke apart during the final phases of its descent over the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX said that Starship “began losing the ability to control its attitude” several minutes after engine shutdown, while coasting on a suborbital trajectory. Video of the flight showed the vehicle slowly rolling. That loss of attitude control led to an automated decision not to perform a planned engine relight. “The lack of attitude control resulted in an off-nominal entry, with the ship seeing much larger than anticipated heating on both protected and unprotected areas,” SpaceX stated, with telemetry lost at an altitude of 65 kilometers. The company believes the attitude control issue was caused by the clogging of valves in thrusters used for roll control. SpaceX has added more thrusters for redundancy while upgrading thruster hardware “for improved resilience to blockage.” SpaceX said the Super Heavy booster fired 13 of its 33 Raptor engines after separation for a boostback burn, but six of the engines began shutting down, triggering an early termination of the boostback burn. Only two of 13 engines ignited for the final landing burn, as SpaceX attempted to a soft touchdown of the booster on the ocean surface. SpaceX said it lost contact with the booster 462 meters above the surface. The engine failures, SpaceX concluded, were caused by filter blockage in liquid oxygen lines, keeping propellant from reaching the engines. SpaceX experienced similar problems on previous Starship launches and made changes to the engine design to try to prevent it. “Super Heavy boosters for Flight 4 and beyond will get additional hardware inside oxygen tanks to further improve propellant filtration capabilities,” SpaceX said, along with unspecified “additional hardware and software changes” to improve the reliability of Raptor engine startup. SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk said in April that  he hoped on the upcoming flight to demonstrate that the Super Heavy booster can land on a “virtual tower”  in the Gulf of Mexico. “If the landing on the virtual tower works, then we will actually try on Flight 5 to come back and land on the tower” at Starbase, he said, part of the company’s plan to rapidly reuse Starship vehicles. “That is very much a success-oriented schedule, but it is in the realm of possibility.”",

         "NASA and Boeing moving ahead with Starliner test flight after propulsion issues",
         "https://spacenews.com/nasa-and-boeing-moving-ahead-with-starliner-test-flight-after-propulsion-issues/",
         "LOS ANGELES — NASA and Boeing are preparing for a June 1 launch of the company’s CST-100 Starliner on a crewed test flight after analysis of a helium leak led to the discovery of a “design vulnerability” in the spacecraft’s propulsion system. At a May 24 briefing, officials said they believe  a helium leak detected in a reaction control system (RCS) thruster in the spacecraft’s service module  is caused by a defective seal in a flange that is itself an isolated problem. None of the other thrusters have shown evidence of helium leaks after extensive testing. Engineers discovered the leak shortly after  the May 6 launch scrub for the Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission  caused by an unrelated valve problem in the Atlas 5 rocket’s Centaur upper stage. Testing in the days after the scrub caused the leak to worsen. Steve Stich, NASA commercial crew program manager, said engineers believe that a seal, a rubber ring about the size of a shirt button and the thickness of 10 sheets of paper, in the flange had a defect that grew worse during tests. He said other possibilities included an error installing the seal or foreign object debris that rubbed against the seal. NASA and Boeing concluded that Starliner can fly with the leak as-is. “If we were to remove the seal completely,” said Mark Nappi, Boeing vice president and commercial crew program manager, “the leak rate would not exceed our capability to manage that leak. That made us comfortable that, if this leak were to get worse, it would be acceptable to fly.” The lack of leaks in other thrusters led NASA to conclude that there is no systemic problem. “We have an analysis that backs that up, that says we don’t expect the others to leak,” Stich said. “That’s the confidence that we have that we don’t have a common-cause failure mode.” “This is really not a safety-of-flight issue for ourselves, and we believe that we have a well-understood condition that we can manage,” Nappi concluded. While the study of the helium leak was ongoing, Stich said engineers performed a review of the rest of the propulsion system “just to make sure we didn’t have any other things that we should be concerned about.” That review did turn up something he called a “design vulnerability” with Starliner’s propulsion system where, in a rare circumstance, the spacecraft would not be able to perform a deorbit burn if two adjacent “doghouses” that contain RCS and larger orbital maneuvering and attitude control (OMAC) thrusters failed. That failure, he said, would knock out enough OMAC and RCS thrusters to prevent existing backup plans for carrying out a deorbit burn from being implemented. Engineers developed a new deorbit reentry mode that would use two burns of four RCS thrusters in that scenario. Such a failure mode would be “very remote,” Nappi said, appearing in less than one percent of potential combinations of failures. “It’s a pretty diabolical case,” Stich said. It raised the question, though, of why the design vulnerability was not found in reviews during Starliner’s lengthy development. “The helium leak itself caused us to look a little more in detail” about how elements of the propulsion system interact, Stich said. “It just took us a little time to figure this out now. The question is, should we have seen this earlier? Maybe in a perfect timeframe we might have identified this earlier.” Officials emphasized this was part of the knowledge gained during a test flight program. Nappi said Boeing was looking at several permanent fixes to the problem, using some combination of hardware changes and software modifications, for later Starliner missions. After two weeks of intensive work on Starliner, teams are taking a break over the Memorial Day holiday weekend before resuming final preparations for the launch, scheduled for June 1 at 12:25 p.m. Eastern. That includes a new flight test readiness review on May 29, followed by rollout of the Atlas 5 carrying Starliner to the launch pad May 30. There are backup launch opportunities for the mission June 2, 5 and 6. However, limited-life items on the Atlas 5 rocket could result in a much longer delay if Starliner does not launch much longer after that. Gary Wentz, vice president of government and commercial programs at United Launch Alliance, said the company regularly tests ordnance used in flight termination and other systems on the rocket, but those “expire” later in June and July and would have to be replaced. He suggested that work could lead to a longer delay as ULA reshuffles its launch manifest. “Some of it will come down to a prioritization of missions throughout the rest of the year,” he said, with the company working with NASA and the Space Force on determining which missions should fly in what order. The two NASA astronauts who will fly on Starliner on the CFT mission, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, are back in Houston but remaining in pre-flight medical quarantine as they await their next launch opportunity. Stich said they were taking the delay in stride. “They’re in good spirits,” he said. “I think they worry about us sometimes more than we worry about them.”",

         "Electron launches first NASA PREFIRE Earth science cubesat",
         "Jeff Foust",
         "LOS ANGELES — Rocket Lab launched the first of two NASA Earth science cubesats on an Electron rocket May 25, exactly seven years after the company’s first launch. The Electron lifted off from Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 3:41 a.m. Eastern after a brief hold because of ground winds. It placed into a 525-kilometer sun-synchronous orbit a 6U cubesat that is part of a NASA mission called Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment or PREFIRE. NASA announced it made contract with the PREFIRE cubesat five hours after liftoff, starting an in-orbit checkout of the satellite. It will be joined by a second, identical cubesat launched on another Electron. Both NASA and Rocket Lab said that launch will take place in the “coming days” but did not provide a specific date. NASA previously said it planned to launch the two cubesats no more than three weeks apart. The two PREFIRE cubesats, operating in different sun-synchronous orbital planes,  each carry a thermal infrared spectrometer . The spacecraft will measure the infrared emissions at the poles, filling in gaps in data about those regions that can be used to improve climate models. “This will improve prediction of sea ice loss, ice sheet melt and sea level rise, creating a better understanding of how our planet’s system will change in the coming years,” Karen St. Germain, NASA Earth science division director, said in a statement, “crucial information to farmers tracking changes in weather and water, fishing fleets working in changing seas and coastal communities building resilience.” NASA emphasized its use of commercial technologies in both the launch of the satellites as well as their use of cubesat technologies. NASA selected PREFIRE in 2018 at part of its Earth Venture line of instruments and missions with a cost cap of nearly $33 million. “The PREFIRE cubesats may be small, but they’re going to close a big gap in our knowledge about Earth’s energy budget,” said Laurie Leshin, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the center managing the mission, in the NASA statement. The launch was the sixth this year for Electron and the 48 th  overall for the small launch vehicle. It took place  seven years after the first Electron launch , which failed to reach orbit because of a problem with ground equipment that triggered the rocket’s flight termination system. “Missions like PREFIRE demonstrate the unique benefit of Electron: dedicated launch for small satellites to precise orbits on precise schedules,” Peter Beck, chief executive of Rocket Lab, said in a statement. Rocket Lab had been forecasting as many as 22 Electron launches this year, including two of a suborbital version called HASTE. In a May 6 earnings call, though,  the company said the company will likely fall short of 22 launches  because of what Beck called “a game of manifest whac-a-mole” as customers delay delivery of spacecraft. “It’s just super hard to predict as the customers move around,” he said when asked how many Electron launches the company now expected to carry out in 2024. “But I think it’s fair to say that, at this point, we’ll struggle to achieve 22, but we have line of sight for probably a couple of less than that.”",

         "Sandra Erwin",
         "WASHINGTON —  T he Space Development Agency (SDA)  announced plans  to procure two separate ground systems in support of its experimental missile defense satellites. These systems will be crucial for demonstrating advanced space-based sensors designed to track and destroy hypersonic missile threats. The first program, dubbed Advanced Fire Control Ground Infrastructure (AFCGI), will establish a cloud-based ground system at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. This system will serve as the nerve center to run missile tracking experiments, the first of which is the Foo Fighter constellation — short for Fire-control On Orbit Support to the Warfighter.  Millennium Space Systems r ecently secured a contract  to build eight satellites and provide initial ground support by 2027. “AFCGI represents a critical step towards demonstrating advanced fire control capabilities,” SDA Director Derek Tournear told reporters May 24. The agency is seeking a “common, enduring ground infrastructure” for fire control prototype programs. The Foo Fighter satellites will be used as a testbed for advanced sensor technology capable of detecting and tracking hypersonic missiles. The data collected by these satellites will support the development of a much larger constellation of tracking satellites in low Earth orbit that will be part of the Defense Department’s  Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture . SDA, an agency under the U.S. Space Force, plans to spend about $4 billion a year developing the PWSA.  Missile defense is an extraordinarily complex challenge, requiring seamless data flow between satellites, ground systems, and interceptor missiles to guide them to destroy threats in-flight. Tournear explained that SDA initially planned to acquire a single, generic ground system for all satellite demonstrations. However, the technical complexity of fire-control technology necessitated a different approach.  In addition to AFCGI to command the satellites themselves, SDA will also award a separate Advanced Fire Control Mission Integration (AFCMI) contract for processing and integrating the fire-control tracking data. The AFCMI system will take data from the Foo Fighters and future experiments, analyze it, and standardize the formatting so it can be utilized by the broader missile defense network. A solicitation for the AFCMI system will be issued this summer. A contract award is expected in early 2025, Tournear said. The decision to split the original ground system procurement stemmed from industry feedback, Tournear said. He explained that ground mission integration and data mission integration require distinct skill sets, and the two-pronged approach allows SDA to leverage the expertise best suited for each function.",

         "Bringing generative artificial intelligence to space",
         "Jason Rainbow",
         "TAMPA, Fla. — Amazon Web Services is busy positioning its cloud infrastructure business to capitalize on the promise of generative artificial intelligence for transforming space and other industries. More than 60% of the company’s space and aerospace customers are already using some form of AI in their businesses, according to AWS director of aerospace and satellite Clint Crosier, up from single digits around three years ago. Crosier predicts similar growth over the next few years in space for generative AI, which  uses deep-learning models to answer questions or create content  based on patterns detected in massive datasets, marking a major step up from traditional machine-learning algorithms. Mathematical advances, an explosion in the amount of available data and cheaper and more efficient chips for processing it are a “perfect storm” for the rise of generative AI, he told  SpaceNews  in an interview, helping drive greater adoption of cloud-based applications. “In the last year, AWS has fundamentally reorganized itself internally so that we could put the right teams [and] organizational structure in place … so that we can really double down on generative AI,” he said. He said AWS has created a “generative AI for space” cell of a handful of people to engage with cloud customers to help develop next-generation capabilities. These efforts include a generative AI laboratory for customers to experiment with new ways of using these emerging capabilities.  Crosier sees three main areas for using generative AI in space: geospatial analytics, spacecraft design and constellation management. Earth observation satellite operators such as BlackSky and Capella Space already use these tools to help manage search queries and gain more insights into their geospatial data. It’s early days in the manufacturing sector, but Crosier said engineers are experimenting with how a generative AI model fed with design parameters could produce new concepts by drawing from potentially overlooked data, such as from the automotive industry. “Whether you’re designing a satellite, rocket or spacecraft, you’re letting the generative AI go out and do that exploratory work around the globe with decades of data,” he said, “and then it will come back and bring you novel design concepts that nobody has envisioned before for your team to use as a baseline to start refining.” He said generative AI also has the potential to help operators manage increasingly crowded orbits by helping to simulate testing scenarios. “If I have a constellation of 600 satellites, I want to model how that constellation will behave under various design parameters,” he said.  “Well, I can get a model of two concepts, which leaves me woefully inadequate — but it costs time and money to model them, or I can model an infinite number. Gen AI will tell me what are the top 25 cases I should model for my modeling simulation capability that will give me the best design optimization, and so we’re seeing it used that way.” AWS efforts to accelerate the adoption of these emerging computing capabilities also include scholarships and a commitment announced in November to provide free AI training for two million people worldwide before the end of 2025.",

         "SpaceX sets early June launch of next Starship test flight",
         "Jeff Foust",
         "LOS ANGELES — SpaceX has set a June 5 launch date for its next Starship integrated test flight, with a focus on demonstrating the ability to bring both stages of the vehicle back intact. SpaceX announced May 24 it planned a launch of Starship on its fourth integrated flight test, also known as IFT-4, as soon as June 5 pending receipt of an updated Federal Aviation Administration license. That launch, like the previous three, will be from the company’s Starbase site in South Texas. Having demonstrated that the Starship upper stage, launched by its Super Heavy booster, can reach space, the company now wants to show it can bring both the booster and the ship back intact. “The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,” the company  stated . “The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.” Unlike  the third test flight in March , SpaceX doesn’t plan any in-flight tests of Starship, such as opening the vehicle’s payload bay door or transferring propellant. The vehicle will fly a similar trajectory with a splashdown of the ship in the Indian Ocean. “This flight path does not require a deorbit burn for reentry, maximizing public safety while still providing the opportunity to meet our primary objective of a controlled Starship reentry,” the company stated. SpaceX has made several upgrades to Starship hardware and software from the March flight, incorporating lessons learned from that mission. One change the company called out was that it will jettison the special interstage section between the booster and ship, designed to enable “hot-staging” where the ship ignites its engines while still attached to the booster. Disposing of that interstage after Super Heavy’s post-separation boostback burn, SpaceX stated, will “reduce booster mass for the final phase of flight.” The company also released May 24  details about the issues it encountered on the third Starship flight . While Starship reached space, the vehicle was lost during reentry. The Super Heavy booster separately broke apart during the final phases of its descent over the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX said that Starship “began losing the ability to control its attitude” several minutes after engine shutdown, while coasting on a suborbital trajectory. Video of the flight showed the vehicle slowly rolling. That loss of attitude control led to an automated decision not to perform a planned engine relight. “The lack of attitude control resulted in an off-nominal entry, with the ship seeing much larger than anticipated heating on both protected and unprotected areas,” SpaceX stated, with telemetry lost at an altitude of 65 kilometers. The company believes the attitude control issue was caused by the clogging of valves in thrusters used for roll control. SpaceX has added more thrusters for redundancy while upgrading thruster hardware “for improved resilience to blockage.” SpaceX said the Super Heavy booster fired 13 of its 33 Raptor engines after separation for a boostback burn, but six of the engines began shutting down, triggering an early termination of the boostback burn. Only two of 13 engines ignited for the final landing burn, as SpaceX attempted to a soft touchdown of the booster on the ocean surface. SpaceX said it lost contact with the booster 462 meters above the surface. The engine failures, SpaceX concluded, were caused by filter blockage in liquid oxygen lines, keeping propellant from reaching the engines. SpaceX experienced similar problems on previous Starship launches and made changes to the engine design to try to prevent it. “Super Heavy boosters for Flight 4 and beyond will get additional hardware inside oxygen tanks to further improve propellant filtration capabilities,” SpaceX said, along with unspecified “additional hardware and software changes” to improve the reliability of Raptor engine startup. SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk said in April that  he hoped on the upcoming flight to demonstrate that the Super Heavy booster can land on a “virtual tower”  in the Gulf of Mexico. “If the landing on the virtual tower works, then we will actually try on Flight 5 to come back and land on the tower” at Starbase, he said, part of the company’s plan to rapidly reuse Starship vehicles. “That is very much a success-oriented schedule, but it is in the realm of possibility.”",

         "NASA and Boeing moving ahead with Starliner test flight after propulsion issues",
         "Jeff Foust",
         "LOS ANGELES — NASA and Boeing are preparing for a June 1 launch of the company’s CST-100 Starliner on a crewed test flight after analysis of a helium leak led to the discovery of a “design vulnerability” in the spacecraft’s propulsion system. At a May 24 briefing, officials said they believe  a helium leak detected in a reaction control system (RCS) thruster in the spacecraft’s service module  is caused by a defective seal in a flange that is itself an isolated problem. None of the other thrusters have shown evidence of helium leaks after extensive testing. Engineers discovered the leak shortly after  the May 6 launch scrub for the Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission  caused by an unrelated valve problem in the Atlas 5 rocket’s Centaur upper stage. Testing in the days after the scrub caused the leak to worsen. Steve Stich, NASA commercial crew program manager, said engineers believe that a seal, a rubber ring about the size of a shirt button and the thickness of 10 sheets of paper, in the flange had a defect that grew worse during tests. He said other possibilities included an error installing the seal or foreign object debris that rubbed against the seal. NASA and Boeing concluded that Starliner can fly with the leak as-is. “If we were to remove the seal completely,” said Mark Nappi, Boeing vice president and commercial crew program manager, “the leak rate would not exceed our capability to manage that leak. That made us comfortable that, if this leak were to get worse, it would be acceptable to fly.” The lack of leaks in other thrusters led NASA to conclude that there is no systemic problem. “We have an analysis that backs that up, that says we don’t expect the others to leak,” Stich said. “That’s the confidence that we have that we don’t have a common-cause failure mode.” “This is really not a safety-of-flight issue for ourselves, and we believe that we have a well-understood condition that we can manage,” Nappi concluded. While the study of the helium leak was ongoing, Stich said engineers performed a review of the rest of the propulsion system “just to make sure we didn’t have any other things that we should be concerned about.” That review did turn up something he called a “design vulnerability” with Starliner’s propulsion system where, in a rare circumstance, the spacecraft would not be able to perform a deorbit burn if two adjacent “doghouses” that contain RCS and larger orbital maneuvering and attitude control (OMAC) thrusters failed. That failure, he said, would knock out enough OMAC and RCS thrusters to prevent existing backup plans for carrying out a deorbit burn from being implemented. Engineers developed a new deorbit reentry mode that would use two burns of four RCS thrusters in that scenario. Such a failure mode would be “very remote,” Nappi said, appearing in less than one percent of potential combinations of failures. “It’s a pretty diabolical case,” Stich said. It raised the question, though, of why the design vulnerability was not found in reviews during Starliner’s lengthy development. “The helium leak itself caused us to look a little more in detail” about how elements of the propulsion system interact, Stich said. “It just took us a little time to figure this out now. The question is, should we have seen this earlier? Maybe in a perfect timeframe we might have identified this earlier.” Officials emphasized this was part of the knowledge gained during a test flight program. Nappi said Boeing was looking at several permanent fixes to the problem, using some combination of hardware changes and software modifications, for later Starliner missions. After two weeks of intensive work on Starliner, teams are taking a break over the Memorial Day holiday weekend before resuming final preparations for the launch, scheduled for June 1 at 12:25 p.m. Eastern. That includes a new flight test readiness review on May 29, followed by rollout of the Atlas 5 carrying Starliner to the launch pad May 30. There are backup launch opportunities for the mission June 2, 5 and 6. However, limited-life items on the Atlas 5 rocket could result in a much longer delay if Starliner does not launch much longer after that. Gary Wentz, vice president of government and commercial programs at United Launch Alliance, said the company regularly tests ordnance used in flight termination and other systems on the rocket, but those “expire” later in June and July and would have to be replaced. He suggested that work could lead to a longer delay as ULA reshuffles its launch manifest. “Some of it will come down to a prioritization of missions throughout the rest of the year,” he said, with the company working with NASA and the Space Force on determining which missions should fly in what order. The two NASA astronauts who will fly on Starliner on the CFT mission, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, are back in Houston but remaining in pre-flight medical quarantine as they await their next launch opportunity. Stich said they were taking the delay in stride. “They’re in good spirits,” he said. “I think they worry about us sometimes more than we worry about them.”",

         "Electron launches first NASA PREFIRE Earth science cubesat",
         "Jeff Foust",
         "LOS ANGELES — Rocket Lab launched the first of two NASA Earth science cubesats on an Electron rocket May 25, exactly seven years after the company’s first launch. The Electron lifted off from Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 3:41 a.m. Eastern after a brief hold because of ground winds. It placed into a 525-kilometer sun-synchronous orbit a 6U cubesat that is part of a NASA mission called Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment or PREFIRE. NASA announced it made contract with the PREFIRE cubesat five hours after liftoff, starting an in-orbit checkout of the satellite. It will be joined by a second, identical cubesat launched on another Electron. Both NASA and Rocket Lab said that launch will take place in the “coming days” but did not provide a specific date. NASA previously said it planned to launch the two cubesats no more than three weeks apart. The two PREFIRE cubesats, operating in different sun-synchronous orbital planes,  each carry a thermal infrared spectrometer . The spacecraft will measure the infrared emissions at the poles, filling in gaps in data about those regions that can be used to improve climate models. “This will improve prediction of sea ice loss, ice sheet melt and sea level rise, creating a better understanding of how our planet’s system will change in the coming years,” Karen St. Germain, NASA Earth science division director, said in a statement, “crucial information to farmers tracking changes in weather and water, fishing fleets working in changing seas and coastal communities building resilience.” NASA emphasized its use of commercial technologies in both the launch of the satellites as well as their use of cubesat technologies. NASA selected PREFIRE in 2018 at part of its Earth Venture line of instruments and missions with a cost cap of nearly $33 million. “The PREFIRE cubesats may be small, but they’re going to close a big gap in our knowledge about Earth’s energy budget,” said Laurie Leshin, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the center managing the mission, in the NASA statement. The launch was the sixth this year for Electron and the 48 th  overall for the small launch vehicle. It took place  seven years after the first Electron launch , which failed to reach orbit because of a problem with ground equipment that triggered the rocket’s flight termination system. “Missions like PREFIRE demonstrate the unique benefit of Electron: dedicated launch for small satellites to precise orbits on precise schedules,” Peter Beck, chief executive of Rocket Lab, said in a statement. Rocket Lab had been forecasting as many as 22 Electron launches this year, including two of a suborbital version called HASTE. In a May 6 earnings call, though,  the company said the company will likely fall short of 22 launches  because of what Beck called “a game of manifest whac-a-mole” as customers delay delivery of spacecraft. “It’s just super hard to predict as the customers move around,” he said when asked how many Electron launches the company now expected to carry out in 2024. “But I think it’s fair to say that, at this point, we’ll struggle to achieve 22, but we have line of sight for probably a couple of less than that.”",

         "Sandra Erwin",
         "WASHINGTON —  T he Space Development Agency (SDA)  announced plans  to procure two separate ground systems in support of its experimental missile defense satellites. These systems will be crucial for demonstrating advanced space-based sensors designed to track and destroy hypersonic missile threats. The first program, dubbed Advanced Fire Control Ground Infrastructure (AFCGI), will establish a cloud-based ground system at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. This system will serve as the nerve center to run missile tracking experiments, the first of which is the Foo Fighter constellation — short for Fire-control On Orbit Support to the Warfighter.  Millennium Space Systems r ecently secured a contract  to build eight satellites and provide initial ground support by 2027. “AFCGI represents a critical step towards demonstrating advanced fire control capabilities,” SDA Director Derek Tournear told reporters May 24. The agency is seeking a “common, enduring ground infrastructure” for fire control prototype programs. The Foo Fighter satellites will be used as a testbed for advanced sensor technology capable of detecting and tracking hypersonic missiles. The data collected by these satellites will support the development of a much larger constellation of tracking satellites in low Earth orbit that will be part of the Defense Department’s  Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture . SDA, an agency under the U.S. Space Force, plans to spend about $4 billion a year developing the PWSA.  Missile defense is an extraordinarily complex challenge, requiring seamless data flow between satellites, ground systems, and interceptor missiles to guide them to destroy threats in-flight. Tournear explained that SDA initially planned to acquire a single, generic ground system for all satellite demonstrations. However, the technical complexity of fire-control technology necessitated a different approach.  In addition to AFCGI to command the satellites themselves, SDA will also award a separate Advanced Fire Control Mission Integration (AFCMI) contract for processing and integrating the fire-control tracking data. The AFCMI system will take data from the Foo Fighters and future experiments, analyze it, and standardize the formatting so it can be utilized by the broader missile defense network. A solicitation for the AFCMI system will be issued this summer. A contract award is expected in early 2025, Tournear said. The decision to split the original ground system procurement stemmed from industry feedback, Tournear said. He explained that ground mission integration and data mission integration require distinct skill sets, and the two-pronged approach allows SDA to leverage the expertise best suited for each function.",

         "Bringing generative artificial intelligence to space",
         "Jason Rainbow",
         "TAMPA, Fla. — Amazon Web Services is busy positioning its cloud infrastructure business to capitalize on the promise of generative artificial intelligence for transforming space and other industries. More than 60% of the company’s space and aerospace customers are already using some form of AI in their businesses, according to AWS director of aerospace and satellite Clint Crosier, up from single digits around three years ago. Crosier predicts similar growth over the next few years in space for generative AI, which  uses deep-learning models to answer questions or create content  based on patterns detected in massive datasets, marking a major step up from traditional machine-learning algorithms. Mathematical advances, an explosion in the amount of available data and cheaper and more efficient chips for processing it are a “perfect storm” for the rise of generative AI, he told  SpaceNews  in an interview, helping drive greater adoption of cloud-based applications. “In the last year, AWS has fundamentally reorganized itself internally so that we could put the right teams [and] organizational structure in place … so that we can really double down on generative AI,” he said. He said AWS has created a “generative AI for space” cell of a handful of people to engage with cloud customers to help develop next-generation capabilities. These efforts include a generative AI laboratory for customers to experiment with new ways of using these emerging capabilities.  Crosier sees three main areas for using generative AI in space: geospatial analytics, spacecraft design and constellation management. Earth observation satellite operators such as BlackSky and Capella Space already use these tools to help manage search queries and gain more insights into their geospatial data. It’s early days in the manufacturing sector, but Crosier said engineers are experimenting with how a generative AI model fed with design parameters could produce new concepts by drawing from potentially overlooked data, such as from the automotive industry. “Whether you’re designing a satellite, rocket or spacecraft, you’re letting the generative AI go out and do that exploratory work around the globe with decades of data,” he said, “and then it will come back and bring you novel design concepts that nobody has envisioned before for your team to use as a baseline to start refining.” He said generative AI also has the potential to help operators manage increasingly crowded orbits by helping to simulate testing scenarios. “If I have a constellation of 600 satellites, I want to model how that constellation will behave under various design parameters,” he said.  “Well, I can get a model of two concepts, which leaves me woefully inadequate — but it costs time and money to model them, or I can model an infinite number. Gen AI will tell me what are the top 25 cases I should model for my modeling simulation capability that will give me the best design optimization, and so we’re seeing it used that way.” AWS efforts to accelerate the adoption of these emerging computing capabilities also include scholarships and a commitment announced in November to provide free AI training for two million people worldwide before the end of 2025.",

         "SpaceX sets early June launch of next Starship test flight",
         "Jeff Foust",
         "LOS ANGELES — SpaceX has set a June 5 launch date for its next Starship integrated test flight, with a focus on demonstrating the ability to bring both stages of the vehicle back intact. SpaceX announced May 24 it planned a launch of Starship on its fourth integrated flight test, also known as IFT-4, as soon as June 5 pending receipt of an updated Federal Aviation Administration license. That launch, like the previous three, will be from the company’s Starbase site in South Texas. Having demonstrated that the Starship upper stage, launched by its Super Heavy booster, can reach space, the company now wants to show it can bring both the booster and the ship back intact. “The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,” the company  stated . “The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.” Unlike  the third test flight in March , SpaceX doesn’t plan any in-flight tests of Starship, such as opening the vehicle’s payload bay door or transferring propellant. The vehicle will fly a similar trajectory with a splashdown of the ship in the Indian Ocean. “This flight path does not require a deorbit burn for reentry, maximizing public safety while still providing the opportunity to meet our primary objective of a controlled Starship reentry,” the company stated. SpaceX has made several upgrades to Starship hardware and software from the March flight, incorporating lessons learned from that mission. One change the company called out was that it will jettison the special interstage section between the booster and ship, designed to enable “hot-staging” where the ship ignites its engines while still attached to the booster. Disposing of that interstage after Super Heavy’s post-separation boostback burn, SpaceX stated, will “reduce booster mass for the final phase of flight.” The company also released May 24  details about the issues it encountered on the third Starship flight . While Starship reached space, the vehicle was lost during reentry. The Super Heavy booster separately broke apart during the final phases of its descent over the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX said that Starship “began losing the ability to control its attitude” several minutes after engine shutdown, while coasting on a suborbital trajectory. Video of the flight showed the vehicle slowly rolling. That loss of attitude control led to an automated decision not to perform a planned engine relight. “The lack of attitude control resulted in an off-nominal entry, with the ship seeing much larger than anticipated heating on both protected and unprotected areas,” SpaceX stated, with telemetry lost at an altitude of 65 kilometers. The company believes the attitude control issue was caused by the clogging of valves in thrusters used for roll control. SpaceX has added more thrusters for redundancy while upgrading thruster hardware “for improved resilience to blockage.” SpaceX said the Super Heavy booster fired 13 of its 33 Raptor engines after separation for a boostback burn, but six of the engines began shutting down, triggering an early termination of the boostback burn. Only two of 13 engines ignited for the final landing burn, as SpaceX attempted to a soft touchdown of the booster on the ocean surface. SpaceX said it lost contact with the booster 462 meters above the surface. The engine failures, SpaceX concluded, were caused by filter blockage in liquid oxygen lines, keeping propellant from reaching the engines. SpaceX experienced similar problems on previous Starship launches and made changes to the engine design to try to prevent it. “Super Heavy boosters for Flight 4 and beyond will get additional hardware inside oxygen tanks to further improve propellant filtration capabilities,” SpaceX said, along with unspecified “additional hardware and software changes” to improve the reliability of Raptor engine startup. SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk said in April that  he hoped on the upcoming flight to demonstrate that the Super Heavy booster can land on a “virtual tower”  in the Gulf of Mexico. “If the landing on the virtual tower works, then we will actually try on Flight 5 to come back and land on the tower” at Starbase, he said, part of the company’s plan to rapidly reuse Starship vehicles. “That is very much a success-oriented schedule, but it is in the realm of possibility.”",

Engineers discovered the leak shortly after  the May 6 launch scrub for the Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission  caused by an unrelated valve problem in the Atlas 5 rocket’s Centaur upper stage. Testing in the days after the scrub caused the leak to worsen. Steve Stich, NASA commercial crew program manager, said engineers believe that a seal, a rubber ring about the size of a shirt button and the thickness of 10 sheets of paper, in the flange had a defect that grew worse during tests. He said other possibilities included an error installing the seal or foreign object debris that rubbed against the seal. NASA and Boeing concluded that Starliner can fly with the leak as-is. “If we were to remove the seal completely,” said Mark Nappi, Boeing vice president and commercial crew program manager, “the leak rate would not exceed our capability to manage that leak. That made us comfortable that, if this leak were to get worse, it would be acceptable to fly.” The lack of leaks in other thrusters led NASA to conclude that there is no systemic problem. “We have an analysis that backs that up, that says we don’t expect the others to leak,” Stich said. “That’s the confidence that we have that we don’t have a common-cause failure mode.” “This is really not a safety-of-flight issue for ourselves, and we believe that we have a well-understood condition that we can manage,” Nappi concluded. While the study of the helium leak was ongoing, Stich said engineers performed a review of the rest of the propulsion system “just to make sure we didn’t have any other things that we should be concerned about.” That review did turn up something he called a “design vulnerability” with Starliner’s propulsion system where, in a rare circumstance, the spacecraft would not be able to perform a deorbit burn if two adjacent “doghouses” that contain RCS and larger orbital maneuvering and attitude control (OMAC) thrusters failed. That failure, he said, would knock out enough OMAC and RCS thrusters to prevent existing backup plans for carrying out a deorbit burn from being implemented. Engineers developed a new deorbit reentry mode that would use two burns of four RCS thrusters in that scenario. Such a failure mode would be “very remote,” Nappi said, appearing in less than one percent of potential combinations of failures. “It’s a pretty diabolical case,” Stich said. It raised the question, though, of why the design vulnerability was not found in reviews during Starliner’s lengthy development. “The helium leak itself caused us to look a little more in detail” about how elements of the propulsion system interact, Stich said. “It just took us a little time to figure this out now. The question is, should we have seen this earlier? Maybe in a perfect timeframe we might have identified this earlier.” Officials emphasized this was part of the knowledge gained during a test flight program. Nappi said Boeing was looking at several permanent fixes to the problem, using some combination of hardware changes and software modifications, for later Starliner missions. After two weeks of intensive work on Starliner, teams are taking a break over the Memorial Day holiday weekend before resuming final preparations for the launch, scheduled for June 1 at 12:25 p.m. Eastern. That includes a new flight test readiness review on May 29, followed by rollout of the Atlas 5 carrying Starliner to the launch pad May 30. There are backup launch opportunities for the mission June 2, 5 and 6. However, limited-life items on the Atlas 5 rocket could result in a much longer delay if Starliner does not launch much longer after that. Gary Wentz, vice president of government and commercial programs at United Launch Alliance, said the company regularly tests ordnance used in flight termination and other systems on the rocket, but those “expire” later in June and July and would have to be replaced. He suggested that work could lead to a longer delay as ULA reshuffles its launch manifest. “Some of it will come down to a prioritization of missions throughout the rest of the year,” he said, with the company working with NASA and the Space Force on determining which missions should fly in what order. The two NASA astronauts who will fly on Starliner on the CFT mission, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, are back in Houston but remaining in pre-flight medical quarantine as they await their next launch opportunity. Stich said they were taking the delay in stride. “They’re in good spirits,” he said. “I think they worry about us sometimes more than we worry about them.”",

      "News1: WASHINGTON — SpaceX has completed the first reusable orbital launch since the retirement of the U.S. space shuttle, delivering the SES-10 telecommunications satellite into geostationary transfer orbit with a rocket that first flew last April for NASA. SpaceX launched the Falcon 9 at 6:27 p.m. Eastern from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center, achieving a historic milestone for the company that hung its cape on the claim that rockets can be re-flown, and that reusability is necessary to take humanity to Mars.  SES entrusted SpaceX with SES-10, a 5,300-kilogram satellite equipped with 55 Ku-band beams for television broadcast and internet connectivity across Latin America. SES-10 is the second satellite the Luxembourg-based satellite operator flew on what would classify as an inaugural flight for SpaceX. In 2013, SpaceX launched SES-8 on a Falcon 9, marking the first time the rocket ever delivered a spacecraft to geostationary transfer orbit. All previous Falcon 9 missions had been to low Earth orbit.  SpaceX landed the first stage of the rocket a second time, returning the booster to the drone ship  Of Course I Still Love You  in the Atlantic Ocean moments before the second stage engine finished burning. SES-10, built by France-based Airbus Defence and Space, separated from the second stage about 32 minutes after liftoff, completing the commercial purpose of the mission. The company confirmed the satellite was operating as planned after separation.  In a pre-recorded video shown during the SpaceX webcast, Gwynne Shotwell, president and COO of SpaceX, described the SES-10 mission as “the fundamental key demonstration that our technology is capable of reflight.”  SpaceX spent four months evaluating, testing and refurbishing the rocket, which previously launched with a Dragon spacecraft carrying supplies to the International Space Station on April 8, 2016, before clearing the rocket for this mission. Shotwell said the goal is to reduce that time from four months down to the same day.  Shotwell said SpaceX is working on a final iteration of the Falcon 9 that will debut later this year that can re-launch multiple times.  “The final vehicle design spin that we are doing on Falcon 9 — that we will be flying later this year — that should be capable of up to 10 or even more [launches],” she said. Earlier this month at the Satellite 2017 conference, Shotwell said SpaceX anticipates launching up to six pre-flown boosters this year. The “flight-proven” rockets, as SpaceX calls them, should enable the launch services provider to execute on its backlog, which currently includes several delayed missions.  In the long term, SpaceX intends to use a larger rocket dubbed the Interplanetary Transport System to take crew and supplies to Mars and other worlds.  “Given the goals of SpaceX are to provide space transportation to allow people to move to other planets,” said Shotwell, “we are not one-way trip to Mars people. We want to make sure that whoever we take can come back, and from that perspective, you need to have a reusable system. We want to provide a full transportation system, and that doesn’t mean one way, that means two ways.” Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of SpaceX, described the launch as one that “is going to ultimately lead a huge revolution in spaceflight.” “It’s been 15 years to get to this point,” he said. “It’s taken us a long time. [There were] a lot of difficult steps along with way, but I am just incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for being able to achieve this incredible milestone in the history of space.” Payload fairing recovery and future plans Musk said in a post-mission press conference that SpaceX was able to recover the two halves of the payload fairing as well after the launch. The fairing, which shields the satellite on its way to space, costs $6 million, he said. “The fairing has its own thruster control system and a steerable parachute,” he said. “It’s like its own little spacecraft.” SpaceX might also try to save the second stage. This wasn’t in the company’s original plans, Musk said, but since the second stage already burns up in the atmosphere at the end of each mission, he said there was nothing really to lose by trying.  Martin Halliwell, chief technology officer of SES, said his company has three more launches with SpaceX this year and is considering flying two of them on flight-proven Falcon 9 rockets.  Including SES-10, SpaceX has completed four launches this year. Musk said SpaceX has around 20 more launches to perform by year’s end. Musk declined to give an exact price reduction for flight proven Falcon 9s, but said he is “highly confident that is it possible to achieve a 100-fold reduction in the cost of space transport.” That 100-fold drop won’t translate immediately to lower cost launches, he said, because SpaceX needs to recoup research and development costs for reusability.  “But it will certainly be less than the current price of our rockets, obviously, and it will be far lower than any other rocket in the world,” Musk said. \n",

      "News2: WASHINGTON — SpaceX launched 88 satellites on a Falcon 9 June 30 on the company’s second dedicated smallsat rideshare mission. The Falcon 9 lifted off from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 3:31 p.m. Eastern, more than halfway into a nearly hourlong launch window because of weather. A launch attempt the day before was scrubbed  when a private helicopter entered restricted airspace minutes before the scheduled liftoff . Deployment of the payload of 88 satellites started nearly 58 minutes after liftoff, once the upper stage performed a second burn of its engine to place it into a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of nearly 550 kilometers. The satellites, from a variety of government and commercial customers, were released over half an hour. The mission, named Transporter-2 by SpaceX, was the company’s second dedicated smallsat rideshare mission,  after the Transporter-1 mission in January . The earlier flight carried 143 satellites, but SpaceX said the total payload mass for Transporter-2 was greater than that of Transporter-1. The company did not disclose specific payload mass figures for either mission. SpaceX established its smallsat rideshare program nearly two years ago, offering low-cost launches on dedicated Falcon 9 missions like Transporter-2 as well as on launches of its Starlink satellites. It has attracted significant interest from both companies and government agencies. The Transporter-2 payload manifest featured synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites from three competing companies: Capella, Iceye and Umbra. HawkEye 360 and Kleos, two companies deploying constellations to perform radio-frequency tracking, each had satellites on this mission, as did PlanetIQ and Spire, which collect GPS radio occultation data for use in weather forecasting. Other commercial customers included Astrocast and Swarm, which are each developing internet-of-things constellations, and Satellogic,  which has a multi-launch agreement with SpaceX  for launching its imaging satellites. SpaceX flew three of its own Starlink satellites on the launch, which will join 10 Starlink satellites launched into polar orbit on Transporter-1. The  Pentagon’s Space Development Agency (SDA) had four satellites on Transporter-2 . Two Mandrake-2 satellites — originally intended to launch on Transporter-1 before being damaged in prelaunch processing — feature optical crosslinks and will be used to test technologies for future low Earth orbit military satellite. Two cubesats built by General Atomics will also test optical communications between satellites and with drones. SDA has a fifth payload on Loft Orbital’s YAM-3 satellite. NASA flew two smallsats on Transporter-2, including a pathfinder for a cubesat constellation called TROPICS, for Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats. TROPICS Pathfinder is identical to the six TROPICS satellites that Astra will launch on its Rocket 3 small launch vehicle in 2022 and will enable full testing of the satellite design in advance of the deployment of the constellation. Many of the customers worked with launch services providers such as D-Orbit, Exolaunch and Spaceflight. That included two Sherpa tugs from Spaceflight on this launch, one of which has electric propulsion from Apollo Fusion. Launch cadence and reusability Transporter-2 was SpaceX’s 20th Falcon 9 mission of the year, with six months yet to go. In only two years has SpaceX conducted more orbital launches: 21 in 2018 and 26 in 2020. The company is on track to shatter the record set last year, even with an anticipated slowdown of launches in July and August. A key factor in that high launch cadence is reusability. The Falcon 9 booster used for Transporter-2 was making its eighth flight, concluding with a landing at Cape Canaveral’s Landing Zone 1. Its first launch was exactly one year ago, when it launched a GPS 3 satellite, and was also used for launching Turksat 5A and five Starlink missions before Transporter-2. Other Falcon 9 boosters have flown up to 10 times. While SpaceX previously set a goal of 10 flights per booster, company officials have in recent months suggested those boosters could fly more than 10 times. “We’ve got boosters now that have flown 10 times, and some that are slated to fly 20 or possibly 30 times,” Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of SpaceX, said in a June 29 appearance at the Mobile World Congress. “With Falcon 9, we’ve achieved I think the most efficient reusability of any rocket to date,” he said, but added that SpaceX will take reusability “to another level” with its Starship vehicle. That vehicle, whose first orbital launch Musk now says will take place in the “next few months,” is intended to be reflown without any significant refurbishment, like an airliner. “The Holy Grail for rocketry is rapidly reusable reliable rockets,” he said.\n",

      "News3: WASHINGTON —  SpaceX ’s new Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket will perform its inaugural flight in June from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and then fly in early July from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., for its first commercial geostationary satellite launch, a SpaceX official said March 19. Barry Matsumori, Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) senior vice president for commercial sales and business development, said the Hawthorne, Calif.-based company expects to be able to launch as often as every three weeks. This is the year that SpaceX is scheduled to make its first big splash into the commercial market. The company has lined up more than $1 billion in commercial satellite launch orders to complement its NASA business, in part by offering prices of $60 million or less for midsize commercial telecommunications satellites. The June launch of Canada’s Cassiope satellite will be into low Earth orbit but will test the new Falcon 9 sufficiently to prepare for a July launch of the  SES -8 telecommunications satellite into geostationary transfer orbit, the company says. Following the launch of the SES-8 satellite, owned by SES of Luxembourg, SpaceX plans a late-July launch of the Thaicom 6 telecommunications satellite for satellite fleet operator Thaicom of Thailand, Matsumori said during a Satellite 2013 panel discussion. Sometime during the fall, SpaceX will launch a group of second-generation Orbcomm machine-to-machine messaging satellites for service provider Orbcomm. These satellites are intended for low Earth orbit. The company plans to round out the year with a launch of its Dragon cargo supply capsule to the international space station, Matsumori said.\n",

      "News4: MT LAUREL, New Jersey — SpaceX launched the U.S. Air Force’s newest GPS satellite Dec. 23 on a Falcon 9 rocket, completing the company’s 21st and final launch of the year. The rocket lifted off at 8:51 a.m. Eastern from Cape Canaveral, Florida, following technical and weather-related delays that pushed the mission out five days. Its payload, the first GPS 3 satellite from Lockheed Martin, separated from the rocket one hour and 59 minutes later.  The launch was a double milestone for SpaceX, setting a new record over last year’s 18 launches, and fulfilling the company’s first defense mission competed through the Air Force’s Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program.  SpaceX’s record annual performance, which included the first-ever launch of a Falcon Heavy, was nonetheless short of the company’s initial forecast of  30 to 40 launches . SpaceX has increased its launch cadence rapidly, up from eight missions in 2016 and six in 2015 (Falcon 9 failures in both those years limited launch rates).  SpaceX has launched other national security missions, such as the National Reconnaissance Office’s classified NROL-76 satellite and the Air Force’s X-37B uncrewed spaceplane, both in 2017. The Air Force has selected SpaceX to launch another four GPS 3 satellites in addition to today’s mission.  SpaceX did not recover the Falcon 9 first stage, having devoted fuel that would have been used to land the booster instead to mission requirements for lofting the 4,400-kilogram satellite into a highly elliptical orbit. From there the satellite will circularize into a medium Earth orbit, joining the U.S.’s GPS constellation of 31 older satellites delivering positioning, navigation, and timing services to more than four billion users.  The new GPS 3 satellite replaces an aging GPS 2R spacecraft launched in 1997. Lockheed Martin is building the first 10 GPS 3 satellites through contracts awarded in 2008 and 2016. This September the Air Force selected Lockheed Martin to build  up to 22 more GPS 3 satellites  after reopening the program to competition amid schedule delays and cost overruns. The GPS 3 program is more than four years behind its original schedule for a first launch. Lockheed Martin said it has addressed the problems that beset the first few satellites, but the company was aided in winning the additional GPS 3 builds by the absence of Boeing and Northrop Grumman — two anticipated contenders that ultimately chose not to bid in the Air Force’s recompete.  GPS 3 broadcasts a stronger signal to counter electronic jamming. It will be the first GPS satellite to broadcast four civil signals, and the first to do launch and control checkout with the Air Force’s new ground control system: OCX Block 0. Because it’s the first of its kind, the checkout of the new satellite could take from six to nine months. On orbit checkout will begin about 10 days from launch. Once it’s declared operational, about six to nine more months of tests are planned to integrate the new satellite into the constellation. Lockheed Martin has manufactured 18 of the 31 GPS satellites currently in operation. The first GPS 3 vehicle is estimated to cost $529 million. It was nicknamed “Vespucci” after the Italian explorer. The GPS 3 satellites Lockheed Martin is building are designed to operate for at least 15 years. The Air Force intends to launch the second GPS 3 satellite next year.

      "News5: Updated 6:05 p.m. Eastern. WASHINGTON — SpaceX completed a “doubleheader” of launches June 25 with the launch of a second set of next-generation Iridium satellites from California, two days after another Falcon 9 from the East Coast. The SpaceX Falcon 9 lifted off in foggy conditions from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 4:25 p.m. Eastern. The initial phases of the launch went as planned, with the second stage entering low Earth orbit for a coast phase prior to a second burn and then spacecraft separation. All 10 satellites separated as planned during a 15-minute period that concluded one hour and 12 minutes after liftoff. The rocket’s first stage made a landing on a drone ship in the Pacific Ocean, touching down as planned despite concerns that conditions were “marginal” for the landing because of winds. This was the ninth consecutive flight with a successful landing, on a drone ship or on land, for launches where the company attempted a landing. The launch is the second in a little more than 48 hours for SpaceX. On June 23, a Falcon 9 launched the BulgariaSat-1 satellite from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, using a first stage that previously launched the first batch of Iridium Next satellites in January. That stage made a hard, but successful, landing on a ship in the Atlantic Ocean. The launch is the first to feature the use of new grid fins on the rocket’s first stage, which steer the stage towards its landing site. Previous rockets used aluminum fins, while this vehicle has larger fins made of titanium. “Flying with larger & significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins,” SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted June 24. “Can take reentry heat with no shielding.” The aluminum fins suffered wear and tear during the reentries, which Musk said will no longer be an issue with the titanium ones. The new fins, he said, are “slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but [have] more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups.” The larger fins, he added, are better suited for the company’s larger Falcon Heavy rocket, whose first flight is planned for later this year, and also allows the first stage to land in stronger winds. The rocket placed into orbit the second set of 10 Iridium Next satellites for Iridium. Six more launches are scheduled over the next 12 months to place the remaining Iridium Next satellites into orbit. “Right now, it’s two down with six more launches to go,” Iridium Chief Executive Matt Desch said in a post-launch statement. “Our operations team is eagerly awaiting this new batch of satellites and is ready to begin the testing and validation process.” Those satellites will be “slot swapped” into the operational constellation, replacing existing spacecraft, after several weeks of on-orbit tests and maneuvers. While this launch used a new Falcon 9 first stage, Desch said in a call with reporters June 19 that  he would be open to launching some of the later missions on previously-flown Falcon 9 first stages , if the use of that hardware could accelerate his launch schedule.\n",
